# A Real-time-pizza Application

### In this project we have build a realtime online pizza order app using Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. we have used tailwind css and Saas for frontend as a css framework and will be using EJS template engine as well. we will be using socket.io for realtime communication.

### Using This app we will be able to order a pizza and get realtime notifications about pizza status. 

### It's Architecture and working principles are inspired by swiggy or Zomato. But offcourse it's not as scaleable as they are now a days.
